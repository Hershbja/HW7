I guess i would use instagram, my social media activity was broad and generalized.
I would do photo upload.

Test 1 would be deploying an alert if the program has no access to photos
Code 1 would be to check if the program has access to photos

Test 2 would be to show photos that are valid format
Code 2 would be checking each photo for valid format then displaying them if they do

Test 3 would be to upload photo with text from user
Code 3 would to collect photo and then collect user input, then sends it to the internet for other users to look at it.
